#### jQuery
- select elements
- do something
- event listener
- $('li')
- ^ jquery variable ^css style selector
- jQueryObject.method
- link at bottom of body, but before js files used
- use cdn for jquery or download jquery
- why use jquery? less code, it's faster to code, simpler to understand, efficient, works with all browsers, even if it's less popular these days vs when it was new, everyone knows how to use it
- can use css psudo selectors
- .val()
- .html()
- .text()
- .show()
- .hide()
- .each()
- .remove()
- adding elements:
- .before()
- .after()
- .prepend()
- .append()
- attributes:
- .attr()
- .removeAttr()
- .addClass()
- .removeClass()
- chaining allows multiple jQuery methods on the same selection
```
- use $(document).ready(function() {
// script
}
```
- ^ checks that the page is ready for your code to work with
```
$(function() {
//script
}
```
- works too
- convention is to use $ in variable names that reprsent jquery objects
- .css() retrieve and set css properties
- jquery uses the concept of getters and setters
- $(this) selectio containing the current element
- .on('click', function)
- can filter to subset of elements
- can do animations, transitions, and effects
- jQuery DOM traversal:
- .find()
- .closest()
- .parent()
- .parents()
- .children()
- .siblings()
- .next()
- .nextAll()
- .prev()
- .prevAll()
- Once you have a jQuery selection can add or filter selection:
- .add()
- .filter()
- .find()
- .not() / :not()
- .has() / :has()
- :contains()
- .is()
