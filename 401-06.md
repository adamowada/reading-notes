Randint:
```
mport random
print random.randint(1, 5)
```
>>> generate a random number between 1 and 5 inclusive.


Random:
```
import random
random.random() * 100
```
>>> generate a number between 0 and 100


Choice:
```
random.choice( ['red', 'black', 'green'] )
```
>>> generate a random choice


Shuffle:
```
from random import shuffle
x = [[i] for i in range(10)]
shuffle(x)
```
>>> shuffle elements in place


Randrange:
```
random.randrange(start, stop[, step])
```
```
import random
for i in range(3):
    print random.randrange(0, 101, 5)
```
>>> generates random numbers from range, optional step

https://www.edureka.co/blog/risk-analysis-in-software-testing/

Risk analysis as it pertains to software testing, is looking at the project as a whole, analyzing the risk(s), coming up with a plan. Big software projects are business decisions that can fail and have consequences for failure.

" Risk Identification
There are different sets of risks included in the risk identification process. Those are as follows:

Business Risks: This risk is the most common risk associated with our topic. It is the risk that may come from your company or your customer, not from your project.

Testing Risks: You should be well acquainted with the platform you are working on, along with the software testing tools being used.

Premature Release Risk: a fair amount of knowledge to analyze the risk associated with releasing unsatisfactory or untested software is required

Software Risks: You should be well versed with the risks associated with the software development process. "

Risk assessment:
- Effect
- Cause
- Likelihood

" How to perform Risk Analysis?
There are three steps:
- Searching the risk
- Analyzing the impact of each individual risk
- Measures for the risk identified "

Constant time = O(1)
Linear time = O(n)
Quadratic time = O(n^2)
Exponential time = O(2^n)
Logarithmic time = O(log(n))
