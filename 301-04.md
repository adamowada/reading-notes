Game to understand CSS Grid

display: grid;
grid-template-columns: 20% 20% 20% 20% 20%;
grid-template-rows: 20% 20% 20% 20% 20%;
-For example, we previously defined five 20% columns with the rule grid-template-columns: 20% 20% 20% 20% 20%;. This can be simplified as grid-template-columns: repeat(5, 20%);
grid-template-columns doesn't just accept values in percentages, but also length units like pixels and ems. You can even mix different units together.
-Grid also introduces a new unit, the fractional fr. Each fr unit allocates one share of the available space. For example, if two elements are set to 1fr and 3fr respectively, the space is divided into 4 equal shares; the first element occupies 1/4 and the second element 3/4 of any leftover space.
-When columns are set with pixels, percentages, or ems, any other columns set with fr will divvy up the space that's left over.
- ^can also be done in rows
- grid-template is a shorthand property that combines grid-template-rows and grid-template-columns.
For example, grid-template: 50% 50% / 200px; will create a grid with two rows that are 50% each, and one column that is 200 pixels wide.

Here, set three columns to 100px, 3em, and 40% respectively.

grid-column-start: gridNumber;
|| span spanNumber; must be positive
grid-column-end: gridNumber; can be negative or less than start
|| span spanNumber; must be positive

grid-column: startNumber / endNumber; start line and end line

everything grid-column can be grid-row for vertical positioning
can combine grid-column and grid-row properties

grid-area accepts four values separated by slashes: grid-row-start, grid-column-start, grid-row-end, followed by grid-column-end.

One example of this would be grid-area: 1 / 1 / 3 / 6;.

grid-area can overlap other grid-area

overlaping grids can have order. default 0 (seen) higher is less seen. similar to z index
- can be negative
