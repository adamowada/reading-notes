[Responsive Web Design](https://learn.shayhowe.com/advanced-html-css/responsive-web-design/)

Responsive vs Adaptive:
- responsive websites continually and fluidly change based on different factors eg: viewport width
- adaptive are built to a group of preset factors
- combination of the two is best

Mobile means to build a separate website just for mobile users
 - normally bad idea

Best practice is a responsive design that adapts to browsers and viewports
- best of all three worlds

3 Components of responsive web design:
1. flexible layouts
- flexible grid, dynamically resizing to any width
- em units for width, margin, padding
- or vw, vh vmin, vmax units
- don't use px
- take fixed units calculate relative units
2. media queries
- use @media rule in css
- set a max width and min width using logical operators
- can also set portrait mode this way, ie orientation
- can be set by ratio
- mobile first technique when designing page
- use viewport meta tag to define height and/or width
  - value is int or keyword
  - can set viewport scale too
3. flexible media
- makes sure media, images, videos are scalable and change sizes with viewport
- css max-width value, eg 100%
  - based on container

[All About Floats](https://css-tricks.com/all-about-floats/)

Float is CSS positioning property. Floated elements remain a part of the flow of the web page, vs absolue positioning.
- four valid values: left, right, none, inherit
- used for:
  - wrapping text around images
  - web layouts
  - but really just use flexbox or grid
 
 Clear. clear property (eg value = both) puts element beneath floated element(s)
 - values:
   - both, left, right, none
   - inherit not supported by IE
 
 If parent element contained all floats, height 'collapses' to 0
 - therefore, clear float after the floated element, and before close of container
 - empty div method
 - overflow method, overflow css property on parent
 - :after to clear floats, with class like 'clearfix'. combine with:
 ```
 .clearfix:after { 
   content: "."; 
   visibility: hidden; 
   display: block; 
   height: 0; 
   clear: both;
}
```

IE sucks for floats. don't worry about it, floats don't always play nice.
