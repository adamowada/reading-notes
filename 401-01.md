[Pain and Suffering](https://codefellows.github.io/code-401-python-guide/curriculum/class-01/notes/pain_suffering)

401 will be difficult, it will be painful. Pain is not suffering. Suffering is pain without purpose, 401 pain has purpose. Keep your eyes on the prize.

[Beginners Guide to Big O](https://rob-bell.net/2009/06/a-beginners-guide-to-big-o-notation/)

Commenter Al K says this:

```
"Big O specifically describes the worst-case scenario". That is not the case. Big-O notation just describes asymptotic bounds, so it is correct to say something like, for example, "Quicksort is in O(n!)," even though Quicksort's actual worst-case running time will never exceed O(n^2). All Big-O is saying is "for an input of size n, there is a value of n after which quicksort will always take less than n! steps to complete." It does not say "Quicksort will take n! steps in the worst case."
```
I think it's a great way of thinking about Big O notation. Big O notation describes the space (memory) and time (compute steps) complexity of an algorithm, wherein an algorithm will perform at least as well as its Big O notation, which is how Al K describes it. (not necessarily worst case scenario).

O(1) - constant time. will never change based on input size. aka fast

O(N) - space and time complexity grows linearly based on input size. proportional speed.

O(N^2) - quadratic time. performance is the size of input squared. common for nested iterations.

O(2^N) - exponential time. each additional input doubles the space/time required. aka slow

O(log N) - logarithmic time. the fastest theoretical algorithm for finding an item in a sorted list.

[Names and Values in Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AEJHKGk9ns)

multiple names can be assigned to the same value
- x = 23
- y = x
- x = 12
// y = 23 

Assignment never copies data -> mutable aliasing

immutable values can't alias

assignment is the same, but aliasing can make it seem different

lots of things are references, and lots of things are assignments

function arguments are assignments

python has dynamic typing

names have no type values have no scope

python is "call by assignment" if you understand assignment you can understand how it's called.
